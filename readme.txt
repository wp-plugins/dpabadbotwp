== Description ==
dpaBadBot is a php program that was developed to block hacker attacks on WordPress websites. Firslty, you can lock up your WordPress site so that no one can login to your site. Secondly, this program will record every visitor and decide who should be allowed to access your website. It tries to block hackers, bad bots, scrappers, crawlers, spiders, ... It can block by IP address or by name of crawler. The WordPress plugin dpaBadBotWP was developed to tell dpaBadBot when you are working on your WordPress site and allow you to carry on working by sending your IP address to dpaBadBot and thereby allow you unlimited access to your site.
