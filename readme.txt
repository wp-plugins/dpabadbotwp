A little more about the dpaBadBot program (not the plugin) 
Firslty, you can lock up your WordPress site so that no one can login to your site. 
Secondly, this program will record every visitor and decide who should be allowed to access your website. It tries to block hackers, bad bots, scrappers, crawlers, spiders, ... It can block by IP address or by name of web crawler. 

This WordPress plugin, dpaBadBotWP was developed to tell dpaBadBot when you are working on your WordPress site and allowing you to carry on working by sending your IP address to dpaBadBot and thereby allow you unlimited access to your site. By its self this plugin will not be useful if you had not purchased dpaBadBot or downloaded the 30 Day Trial version.

Note: If you are upgrading and the plugin has problems accessing files, DELETE this plugin and reinstall the plugin as all files names were changed to lower case.

It now stops automatic WordPress core updates so that the Bad Bot Exterminator, dpaBadBot, will not be erased.
