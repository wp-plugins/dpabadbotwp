== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

This plugin cannot do anything without the dpaBadBot php program, https://www.dpabadbot.com, installed on your site. dpaBadBot PHP program protects your WordPress site from hackers, login attacks and defends against ddos attacks.

In order to do this effectively dpaBadBot needs your current IP address so that it does not block you from accessing your own site. This where the plugin, dpaBadBotWP, comes in. It sends your IP address to dpaBadBot when you are logged into WordPress.


= How can I edit the message? =

In your WordPress Control Panel, go to menu option Settings > dpaBadBotWPMenu and you will see several options and settings. Only one field needs to be filled up. And that is the directory where dpaBadBot is located on your website. 

Enter the full path directory name into this field. That is it.

You are done.

= Where can I see the change? =

There is nothing to view. Only now you can make idefinite number of views of your WordPress website without being blocked.
